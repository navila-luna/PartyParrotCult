# PartyParrotCult
This is my musical instrument, a step sequencer that has  party parrots jamming out.

Why party parrots? I wanted to create a step sequencer that would produce happy sounds and images resembled a happy mood. I decided Party Parrots were perfect. These goofy parrots always make me laugh and there are many different colored party parrots. The contributors of the  party parrot community is a huge one.  I decided I had to give these party parrots a chance to jam to music and continue their quest of making people laugh and have a good time. Let this be my contribution to the Party Parrot Cult!!
